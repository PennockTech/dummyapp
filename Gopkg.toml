# we don't want to be lost, should be included here in 'required'.

# Note that dep still doesn't handle OS-specific dependencies, so
# if we run into those before dep gains support, then add support
# for calling dep to build/build.from-within-dockerfile.sh

# when it comes to the ~ operator and falling back to equality of the part
# after the 'v'?  I should look into this properly and submit a bug report /
# patch.  (dep v0.4.1)
