# <https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-a-docker-image-on-circleci-2-0/>
#  -- the loose gameplan, reworked a fair bit, especially since we have
#     multi-stage to deal with, so the caching would have been wrong for us
#
# <https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/>
#  -- the default image is currently 17.03.0-ce but multi-stage builds require
#     at least 17.05, so we override; we only _need_ to override for the build
#     stage, but I don't want to debug brokenness when multiple versions of
#     Docker are used at different stages, so we use a consistent image.
#     And remember that there's a distinct shortage of Variable Interpolation
#     which we can use.
